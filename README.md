# Machine learning
* A VAE demo with lots of Tensorflow example code.ipnyb - A couple of ways of building a VAE. Trained on the MNIST dataset and used to create some "deepfake" images from the latent distribution. Lots of good tensorflow example code

* Deep Q:Based on : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMZfgeHFFcA Lunar lander trained using a deep Q network (Need to pip install box2D on top of gym to get the Lander)

* TensorFlow_CustomLayers.ipynb - Subclassing Keras layers and models to optimise with multiple inputs and outputs. Prep work for implmenting I.Halperin and I. Feldshteyn, "Market Self-Learning of Signals, Impact and Optimal Trading: Invisible Hand Inference with Free Energy", https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3174498 as the project in course 3 of I. Halperin's Coursera specialization https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-reinforcement-finance

* TensorFlow_No_Layers.ipynb - Optimization without Keras layers again prep work for Coursera. Implementing "Quantum Equilibrium-Disequilibrium: Asset Price Dynamics, Symmetry Breaking, and Defaults as Dissipative Instantons" https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03607  as the project in course 4 of I. Halperin's Coursera specialization https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-reinforcement-finance


* Trees,Forests and sklearn.ipynb - Simple clasification problem using logistic regression from sklearn, tensorflow and statsmodels and then sklearn CART, random forest and boosted tree plus sklearn naive bayes

* Arima/PairsTrading/Kalman/Annuity - good sample code from courses I've done.
